AIM:
In this experiment, we successfully implemented a simple "Hello World" program in C++.

SOFTWARE USED :
VS Code

Theory:

Operators in C++ are special symbols or keywords used to perform operations on variables and values. They form the foundation of expressions and enable computation, comparison, logical decision-making, and more.

C++ supports a wide variety of operators, categorized as:

      Arithmetic Operators: Used for basic mathematical operations.
                   +, -, *, /, %

    Relational (Comparison) Operators:Used to compare two values.
                    ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

    Logical Operators:Used to perform logical operations.
                  && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT)

     Assignment Operators:Used to assign values to variables.
                   =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=

    Increment and Decrement Operators:Used to increase or decrease a value by 1.
                   ++, -- (prefix and postfix)

    Bitwise Operators:Perform bit-level operations.
                    &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>

    Conditional (Ternary) Operator:A shorthand for if-else.
                   condition ? expression1 : expression2

    sizeof Operator:Returns the size of a data type or object.

    Comma Operator (,):Allows two or more expressions to be evaluated in a single statement.

Operators are essential for building expressions and logic in any C++ program. They help manipulate data and control program behavior efficiently.


SAMPLE OUTPUT:

      Students grading system:
                          Enter marks of subject 1:
                    80
                    Enter marks of subject 2:
                    90
                    Enter marks of subject 3:
                    40
                    Enter marks of subject 4:
                    60
                    Enter marks of subject 5:
                    80
                    Average: 70
                    The grade is: C
                    
    Positive or negative number program:
    
                   Enter a number: 4
                   The number is positive

    identifying quadrant program:

                  Value of x is:
                  4
                  Value of y is:
                  -2
                  (x,y) is in 4th Quadrant 


Conclusion:

    In this experiment, we successfully studied and implemented various  categories of operators in C++ including arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, increment/decrement, bitwise, conditional, and special operators. Understanding how and when to use these operators is fundamental for writing efficient and logical C++ programs. Mastery of operators enhances our ability to construct meaningful expressions and enables the creation of robust and optimized code.
