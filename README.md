AIM:
In this experiment, we successfully implemented a simple "Hello World" program in C++.

SOFTWARE USED :
VS Code

Theory:

Operators in C++ are special symbols or keywords used to perform operations on variables and values. They form the foundation of expressions and enable computation, comparison, logical decision-making, and more.

C++ supports a wide variety of operators, categorized as:

Arithmetic Operators:
Used for basic mathematical operations.
+, -, *, /, %

Relational (Comparison) Operators:
Used to compare two values.
==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

Logical Operators:
Used to perform logical operations.
&& (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT)

Assignment Operators:
Used to assign values to variables.
=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=

Increment and Decrement Operators:
Used to increase or decrease a value by 1.
++, -- (prefix and postfix)

Bitwise Operators:
Perform bit-level operations.
&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>

Conditional (Ternary) Operator:
A shorthand for if-else.
condition ? expression1 : expression2

sizeof Operator:
Returns the size of a data type or object.

Comma Operator (,):
Allows two or more expressions to be evaluated in a single statement.

Operators are essential for building expressions and logic in any C++ program. They help manipulate data and control program behavior efficiently.

Conclusion:
In this experiment, we successfully studied and implemented various categories of operators in C++ including arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, increment/decrement, bitwise, conditional, and special operators. Understanding how and when to use these operators is fundamental for writing efficient and logical C++ programs. Mastery of operators enhances our ability to construct meaningful expressions and enables the creation of robust and optimized code.
